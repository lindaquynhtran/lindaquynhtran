Hi there! I am an undergraduate student studying computer science, data science, and health studies at University of Rhode Island. I have a strong foundation in computer science principles, including algorithms, and data structures and am skilled in a variety of programming languages including Python, and C++.

In addition to my computer science coursework, I have also completed a number of data science courses, including statistical methods of research, numerous math courses and data analysis. I am passionate about using data to drive decision making and am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to real-world problems.

In my free time, you can find me trying new foods from different cultures, watching old and new films, and exploring new technologies. Thank you for stopping by my bio. Thanks for stopping by and feel free to check out my GitHub repository to see some of my past projects and contributions.
